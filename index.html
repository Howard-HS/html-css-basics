        I recently interviewed for a Business Analyst position with the CIO of a large multinational software development firm. This
        man was in charge of the company's worldwide IT operations, including offshore development projects, for which he
        was searching for qualified Business Analysts. The interview quickly became a casual conversation about current trends
        within the IT service sector, how the company was planning to take advantage of those trends, and, most importantly,
        how I could fit into those plans. It was during his evaluation of my skills that I asked how I fit and whether it
        was technical or business skills that were most valuable to his projects. The CIO summed up his advice about my career
        path with one small sentence: "Stay on the business side."
      </p>
      <p>
        Business skills, in this CIO's view, were most important to his future projects and the industry as a whole. His reasoning
        was that he could train anyone in the technical skills he needed for a project, but finding those people with the
        necessary business skills to guide an IT project to success was something that could not easily be obtained. He went
        on to say that he found it difficult to find people who could communicate on even the most basic of levels. I asked
        if my background as a developer would help in getting a business analyst job, and he conceded that although it's
        not a requirement, it certainly would help matters as long as I could prove that I wasn't "too technical."

        His comments are consistent with the trend that all US-based programmers have observed since the late 1990's: global salary
        competition amongst programmers, and a growing view in big business of programming as a commodity skill. It's hard
        to compete with a developer in Russia or India who can work for a fraction of what I make minus benefits. The CIO
        managed to reaffirm the subtle, but major, shift from technical skills to business-technical skills in today's labor
        market. I gave weight to his viewpoint since the people in his position are the trendsetters of the technology industry.
        They are the ones who set the directives for a company's IT needs, and often, the requirements desired for the higher-paying
        positions.

        I did a little research and found that the US Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Outlook Handbook predicts that computer
        systems analysts are expected to be among the fastest growing occupations through 2012. The Handbook describes a
        systems analyst as someone who may plan and develop new computer systems or devise ways to apply existing systems'
        resources to additional operations. It describes a computer programmer as someone who writes programs according to
        the specifications determined by systems analysts. (The book does not separately list business analyst as an occupation.)
      </p>
      <p>
        According to the Handbook, in the US systems analysts held an astounding 487,000 positions in 2004 (up from 468,000 positions
        in 2002) compared with 455,000 jobs in 2004 for computer programmers (down from 499,000 in 2002). The Handbook also
        states that employment for computer programmers is "expected to grow much more slowly than that for other computer
        specialists." And recent estimates by the Economic Policy Institute have put the number of jobs being offshored at
        approximately 330,000 to 500,000 jobs. About 100,000 of those were full-time computer programming jobs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The key to maintaining a good employment outlook in IT, it seems, is to move out of programming and up into more business-oriented
        IT positions such as systems analyst, business analyst, project manager, or systems architect. However, a computer
        programmer can't just decide to become a systems analyst or project manager overnight. The journey takes time and
        requires the right amount of experience and learning to be successful.
