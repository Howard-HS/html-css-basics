      <h2 style="text-align: center;">Making the Shift</h2>
      <p>
        So you've seen the statistics and watched as the jobs in your market slowly disappear. You want to move more to the "business
        side," but you don't quite know how to do it. As I'll describe next, making the shift can be done on-the-job by gaining
        more responsibility, polishing up your problem-solving skills, and using creativity in your work.
      </p>
      <p>
        I began my journey into systems analysis and design by accepting more responsibilities throughout the project I was on when
        things proved too overwhelming for my superiors. I gradually accepted more of the project management and business
        analysis responsibilities when the opportunity presented itself. For example, I would walk to Suzy in accounting
        and work out a new enhancement with her one-on-one rather than wait for my manager to do so. Over time, as my manager's
        confidence in my abilities grew, these responsibilities became a part of my job. It wasn't long before I became the
        Programmer Analyst, and ultimately the Project Manager, as new positions were created to fulfill demand for our work.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the need arises, I recommend walking to the end user yourself and working with her one-on-one. Your manager will be
        relieved when he discovers that you are capable of communicating with his end-users, identifying their issues, and
        resolving those issues before they are brought up in the weekly manager's meeting. Even the best IT managers need
        a subordinate who is visible to the users who they can trust to get the job done. If a manager is slowly factoring
        himself away from the day-to-day workings of the project, welcome it. The higher visibility that you are obtaining
        can be translated into higher valueâ€”and that can result in a promotion. Over time, your increased interactions with
        more business-oriented people will make you more sensitive to business concerns.
      </p>
      <p>
        A good subordinate has to be open-minded and creative. When solving problems, one has to always believe that there is a way
        to accomplish something, even if it's never been done before. Sometimes, just listening to the user will produce
        an idea. A lot of issues may come down to the business process that the system is attempting to replicate. I have
        had users actually solve a business problem for me just by listening to what they had to say!
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you're open-minded and creative or not, you can still work towards more business-oriented positions. After all, business
        systems analysts and project managers are only a small subset of the many positions opening up each year to address
        the issues of complexity through simplicity. If you love programming, you don't have to necessarily give it up.
